# Inquiry-study-2023

The primary goal of the study was to investigate people's judgments about the relation between knowledge and inquiry - in particular, whether people think that knowledge allows one to cease inquiring into some question. 100 participants were recruited through Prolific; participants were required to have met a 95% approval rating. Each participant was presented with the following vignette and question:

Tess is about to take a history test. Her teacher announces:  "I'm going to give you a hint. One of the questions you'll be asked is, 'When did the Roman Empire fall?' You now have five minutes to review your materials before the test begins."  Tess knows from her studying that the Roman Empire fell in 476. However, it has been awhile since she reviewed, so she has some doubts about whether she got the dates right. She has her textbook in from of her. Should Tess check the date?

a) Yes, she should check the date to make sure.

b) No, there's no point in checking since she already knows the answer.

Results: 90% of participants selected option a); the other 10% selected option b).
